				<h2> Preparation </h2>
				<p><i>Namaskar:</i> Before starting the kathak dance, students pay respect through a prayer: <i>Main aap sabko, prithvi ko, eeshwar ko, guru ko pranam karti hoon</i>. This means "I pay respect to the people around me, to the Earth, to God, to Guru". 
				</p>
			  	<p><i>Basic Tatkar/hastak exercices:</i> Students wait in naman position for the Nagma/lehera (beat machine) to start, before starting the footwork/tatkar and arm movements/hastaks, starting from Sum (first beat).
				</p>
				<p><i>Other Tatkar/hastak exercices:</i> This includes travelling forward, backward, sideways while following variations of footwork patterns and combining main hastaks.
				These exercises help improve hand and eye coordination, the centering of the body weight and the alignment of limbs. They also increase students' awareness of space.
				</p>
				<p><i>Chakkar exercises: </i>Following the nagma/lehera, students complete spins of 5/3/2/1 steps/beat(s). It is essential to make each step/beat audible, remain centered, and keep the balance of the body throughout each cycle.

				<h2> Practice </h2>
				<p><i>Tal:</i> Tal is a very important concept in Classical Indian dance and music. <br>A tal is a group of certain beats, some of which are clapped (sum and taali) or not clapped (khali).
				</p>
				<p><i>Padhant:</i> Padhant is the recitation of a composition in tal. Padhant are done against the background of a steady pulse which can be vocal or instrumental. 
				</p>
				<p><i>Nritta:</i> It is the technical aspect of classical Indian dance and is also called "pure dance". It involves compositions made of patterns of footwork, arms/hands movements and spins across various layas/speeds.
				</p>
				<p><i>Nritya:</i> It is the mood and sentiment side of classical Indian dance and is also called "Abhinaya". It involves the expressive use of the footwork, arms/hands movements, mudras, as well as facial expressions to narrate a story.
				</p>
				<p><i>Angika Abhinaya:</i> Abhinaya is expressive aspect of Kathak dance where we use the face and the body to communicate a narrative or "tell a story". 
				<br>Expressive compositions make an extensive use of Asamyukta mudras/single hand movements and samyukta mudras/double hands movements to symbolize divinities, objects, animals, or a wide range of feelings.

				<h2> Wrap up </h2>
				<p><i>Namaskar:</i> Similarly to the start of the kathak dance, we share our gratitude through a prayer.
				</p>
				<p><i>Debrief:</i> This is the chance for the students (shishya) and the teacher (guru) to have informal discussions about their journey through learning the dance. 
				Students can talk about their impressions, their struggles, their discoveries with other students in the presence of the teacher who can intervene to share his/her own experience.
